# Online Natural Language-based Product Configurator

This project is aimed to solve the problem of conventional product configurators by bypassing the need for domain knowledge to properly use it. Instead of technical 
specifications or individual attributes, this product configurator uses Natural Language as an input in the form of text query.

This project contains 4 files:
  - main.py scrapes data from the amazon search results page
  - details.py scrapes data from the products page
  - reviews.py scrapes user reviews from the user reviews page
  - textmine_doc2vec.py runs the Doc2Vec Algorithm for text mining and model building
  
The GUI of this project is contained in the Jupyter Notebook file, better used with nbextensions
